## üìñ About the project
This project takes inspiration from a retail store for fruits and vegetables, an online greengrocer. However, the project features multiple web pages with a routing system in the Angular framework. Additionally, I utilized the Bootstrap framework and its snippets to assemble the pages and also to create various components for use and reuse.
